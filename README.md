## Hi I am Nabil Adnan

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Sylhet Engineering College, with a focus on Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. Currently, I am working at Metrosofts.se as a Machine Learning Intern. My research interests lie at the intersection of planning, reasoning, and grounded decision-making for intelligent systems, with a particular focus on advancing the capabilities of large language models and vision-based architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers.
