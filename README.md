## Hi, I'm Nabil

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I have completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology with a focus on Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. My research interests lie at the intersection of planning, reasoning, and grounded decision-making for intelligent systems, with a particular focus on leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models and vision architectures such as Transformer, Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Parallely I am working on RAG based system development implemented with FastAPI.

🔭 I’m currently working on Squad Innovators as a Software Developer(AI).
